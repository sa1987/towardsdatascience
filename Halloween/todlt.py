You give the user a chance to pick an option â€” Trick or Treat. If the choice is to treat, then you just show a single turtle hit the finish line, and you are awarded a cookie for winning. The image, as well as the voice recording, needs to suggest the reward for the victory. If the choice selected is a trick, then the user gets to place a bet on the two turtles available. So the user has a 50% chance to win a reward of a cake else he gets no reward.
An Additional else case of rock, paper, scissor game can also be added to provide the user with a higher chance to win the game if they lose the first 50% chance.
